# Pacmen_Exercise


## Description
This project implements a simple PacMan game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. PacMen are created dynamically and move around the screen. Collision detection ensures they bounce off the edges of the screen.

## How to Run
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. PacMen will start moving around the screen automatically.

## Roadmap
Future improvements for the project may include:
- Adding scoring functionality.
- Implementing user controls to change PacMan direction.
- Enhancing the visual design of the game.
